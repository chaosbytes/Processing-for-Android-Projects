A couple of the Processing for Android projects I have worked on, including a custom camera contoller compatible with
Android mode, and the beginning work on two games.

> FSCam - A custom camera controller built for Processing. Compatible
with Android mode (Use 1 finger to orbit, 2 finger pinch to zoom)

> PvZClone - A Plants vs. Zombies clone I began some time ago and have
paused work on. Needs a major redesign for efficiency and cleaner
code

> Quicksilver - A concept of a game I was designing. Goal was to touch
a moving sprite and trace to 2 or more other moving sprites of the same
kind. Kind of like a fast paced re-imagining  of bejeweled. Doesn't
work properly since I stopped working on it about 6 months ago. Will
pick it up again when I have more time.
